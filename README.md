#  Node CLI – Automated Node.js Project Generator

![Node CLI Banner](https://dummyimage.com/1200x300/1a1a1a/ffffff&text=Node+Project+CLI+Generator)

### **Hello Techies! 👋**

Every time we start a new Node.js backend project, we repeat the same tasks:
- Creating project folder structure
- Creating controller, model, service & repository files manually
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up MongoDB configuration

This is time-consuming and boring when done again and again.  
So to make development faster and simpler, I created a **CLI tool** that sets up everything automatically with just a command.

## 🎯 Features

✔ Generate scalable folder structure  
✔ Auto-create files with boilerplate code  
✔ MongoDB configuration ready  
✔ Built for clean architecture & maintainability  
✔ Saves time, increases productivity

## 📦 Create New Project

Run the below command to generate project structure:

```bash
abu create <folderType>
```
# 📂 Folder Types Available

| Folder Type | Description                                          |

| `basic`     | Minimal starter project                              |

# 🛠 Generate Files Automatically
